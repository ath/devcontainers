# Flutter Development Container

This project aims to build a development container that allows
developing applications with Dart and Flutter, without the need
to install Dart or Flutter locally on your machine.

The container also provides the option to package applications
for Android, making it easy to develop cross-platform.


# Key Features

- **Dart and Flutter Available**: With this container, you can
begin developing in Dart and Flutter quickly, with everything
you need provided out of the box.

- **Android Support**: There is built-in support for Android
development, enabling you to compile and test applications
running on Android devices.

- **No Local Installation Required**: Users can develop
applications directly from the container, meaning you do not
need to install Dart, Flutter, or Android Studio on your local
machine.


# Conclusion

The development container is designed for convenience, allowing
developers to work in an isolated environment. It facilitates
easier management of dependencies and tools, ensuring that
you can focus on building your applications rather than setting
upon your workspace.

This container setup enhances productivity and simplifies the
development workflow.
